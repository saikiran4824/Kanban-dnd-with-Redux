Technologies Used
React: The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Redux Toolkit: A set of tools to simplify Redux usage.

TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Lodash: A modern JavaScript utility library.

Prettier: Code formatter to ensure consistent code style.

UUID: A library to generate unique identifiers for tasks.

Now, let's dive into how Redux is used specifically in the project:

1.  Redux allows us to manage the state of tasks, columns, and user interactions in a centralized manner.For example, the application needs to store data like:By centralizing all this data in Redux, we ensure that components don't need to manage their own local state for these items. They can simply read from Redux, making it easier to manage and sync the app's state across components.For example, the current state of tasks is stored in Redux. Any component that needs to display tasks can access this state directly from the Redux store.

    -   **Tasks**: The task's ID, description, status 

    -   **Columns**: Each column  and the tasks that belong to it.

    -   **User Interactions**: Things like drag-and-drop actions or editing a task.

2.  The Redux store is divided into **slices**, where each slice represents a part of the application state. A slice contains:In the **Kanban board**, we might define slices for different parts of the app, such as:Each slice contains actions and reducers for modifying the state.Example of a task slice:javascriptCopy// tasksSlice.jsimport { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';const initialState = { tasks: [],};const tasksSlice = createSlice({ name: 'tasks', initialState, reducers: { addTask: (state, action) => { state.tasks.push(action.payload); // Adds a new task }, updateTask: (state, action) => { const task = state.tasks.find(t => t.id === action.payload.id); if (task) { task.content = action.payload.content; // Updates task content } }, deleteTask: (state, action) => { state.tasks = state.tasks.filter(task => task.id !== action.payload.id); // Removes a task }, },});export const { addTask, updateTask, deleteTask } = tasksSlice.actions;export default tasksSlice.reducer;Here, the tasksSlice manages the tasks state and includes three actions: addTask, updateTask, and deleteTask.

    -   **State**: The data you want to store.

    -   **Reducers**: Functions that define how to update the state when actions are dispatched.

    -   **tasksSlice**: Handles the state of tasks (task descriptions, statuses, etc.).

    -   **columnsSlice**: Handles the state of columns (which tasks belong to which columns, etc.).

3.  Actions are dispatched to modify the state. An action is just an object describing the change you want to make. Actions are typically dispatched from components when the user interacts with the UI.For example, when a user adds a new task, you dispatch the addTask action:javascriptCopyimport { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';import { addTask } from './tasksSlice';const TaskForm = () => { const dispatch = useDispatch(); const handleAddTask = () => { const newTask = { id: Date.now(), content: 'New Task' }; dispatch(addTask(newTask)); // Dispatching the action to add a task }; return ( <button onClick={handleAddTask}>Add Task</button> );};Here, the dispatch(addTask(newTask)) line sends the action to Redux, and Redux updates the store based on the addTask reducer in tasksSlice.

4.  The **react-redux** library helps connect the Redux store with React components.Using useSelector(), components can read the state. For example, to display a list of tasks:javascriptCopyimport { useSelector } from 'react-redux';const TaskList = () => { const tasks = useSelector(state => state.tasks.tasks); // Accessing the tasks from Redux store return ( <div> {tasks.map(task => ( <div key={task.id}>{task.content}</div> ))} </div> );};And using useDispatch(), components can dispatch actions to modify the store (like adding, updating, or deleting tasks).

    -   **useSelector()**: This hook is used to access the state from the Redux store. It's similar to mapStateToProps in traditional Redux.

    -   **useDispatch()**: This hook is used to dispatch actions from within components.

### Summary of Redux Flow

1.  **User Interactions** trigger actions (like adding or deleting tasks).

2.  **Dispatching Actions**: The actions are dispatched to Redux.

3.  **Reducers**: The dispatched action is handled by reducers, which update the state in the Redux store.

4.  **State Updates**: Components subscribe to the Redux store using useSelector() to read the updated state.

5.  **UI Re-render**: Once the state is updated, React re-renders the UI with the new state.

This process of centralized state management ensures that the UI remains consistent across different parts of the application, and it's easier to handle complex features like asynchronous data fetching or state persistence.
